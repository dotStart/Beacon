<p>
  In some cases, you may be presented with an error dialog relating to an unsupported Java version
  or the application may not launch at all. In these cases generally follow these steps:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Uninstall <em>all</em> Java versions on your system (JREs <em>and</em> JDKs)</li>
  <li>Reinstall the recommended version of Java (see below)</li>
</ol>

<div class="ui warning message">
  <div class="header">System Path and JAVA_HOME</div>
  Always ensure that the System Path and <code>JAVA_HOME</code> are configured during the
  installation (they may be unchecked within the installer if prior versions mis-configured these
  properties and failed to remove them upon uninstallation. This issue typically does not apply to
  Linux users.
</div>

<p>
  Generally, you should avoid installing older versions as well (such as Java 8). Typically
  applications operate fine on newer versions (especially as games like Minecraft ship their own
  versions of the Java runtime along with the game). Older installations may clash and (in case of
  Oracle's versions) fail to properly register with your system.
</p>

<div class="ui info message">
  <div class="header">Installing older Java Versions</div>
  If you really need an older version of Java installed on your system, install it last and ensure
  these installations do not configure <code>JAVA_HOME</code> and are not present within the system
  path (these options are typically presented within your installer). Linux users may need to
  consult their respective distribution's documentation on how to select the default installation.
</div>

<p>If the issue persists, please seek assistance via the support channels.</p>

<h2 class="ui header">Java Versions</h2>

<p>
  At the time of writing, the recommended Java distribution is
  <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/">AdoptOpenJDK</a> in version 11 (choose the HotSpot based
  implementation for maximal compatibility). Newer versions of AdoptOpenJDK may also work without
  issues but are currently not recommended due to API changes within version 15 of the
  specification.
</p>

<p>
  Oracle versions should generally be avoided as their installers traditionally caused serious
  issues regarding the registration of the Java installation within the System Path (as well as the
  creation of the <code>JAVA_HOME</code> environment variable).
